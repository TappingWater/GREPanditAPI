# Overview

Language: Golang
Framework: Echo

## Structure

Code structure promotes separation of concerns by organizing the code into distinct layers:

- Handlers: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Services: Implement business logic
- Models: Define data structures
- Database: Manage database connections and schema
- Middleware: Provide additional functionality or processing

### cmd/server/main.go

This is the main entry point of your application. It's responsible for initializing the Echo framework, setting up middleware, configuring the database, registering routes and handlers, and starting the server.

### internal/handlers/

This directory contains the HTTP handlers for different API endpoints. Each file corresponds to a specific resource or group of related resources, e.g., user_handler.go contains handlers for user-related endpoints.

### internal/models/

This directory contains the data structures (structs) representing your application's domain models, e.g., user.go defines the User struct.

### internal/services/

This directory contains the business logic for your application. Services are responsible for interacting with the database and performing any necessary data transformations or validations. Each file corresponds to a specific resource or group of related resources, e.g., user_service.go contains methods for creating, fetching, updating, and deleting users.

### internal/database/

This directory contains the logic for connecting to the database and initializing the necessary tables or indexes. The database.go file exports a function for setting up the database connection, which can be used in main.go.

### internal/middleware/

This directory contains custom middleware for your application, e.g., custom_middleware.go. Middleware can be used for various purposes, such as logging, authentication, or request/response transformation.

### go.mod and go.sum

These files are automatically generated by Go when you run go mod init and manage your project's dependencies.
